Looks like you **did not link your gif walkthrough** for this assignment or it is **not rendering (animating)** properly when viewed in the README :grimacing:. The gif helps us to make sure we don't miss any required or optional stories you have completed.
**Render your gif:**
Once you have uploaded your gif to a site like [imgur](http://imgur.com/) you can render it using the following syntax.
```markdown
<img src="my_gif_address.gif", width=250 />
```
**Make sure you have completed the following steps to completing your README:**
1. Make sure you have the correct README for this assignment, go to the "Setup" section in Assignment Tab for the corresponding week in the [course portal](https://courses.codepath.org).
2. Please mark all implemented stories `[x]`
3. Add a link to your animated gif walkthrough to your README and make sure it renders (animates) when viewing the README.
Your assignment is incomplete until the GIF is valid. Once resolved, please push your updates and **submit your assignment again through the Course Portal (within 48 hours from the posted deadline) so we can regrade it**. We will no longer review resubmissions made after this date.
Still confused about how to properly submit your assignment? Check out the [Submitting Coursework](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/submitting_coursework.md) for detailed instructions.
Whenever you make updates to your project that require re-grading, you need to **re-submit** your project using the submit button on the associated assignment page in the course portal. This will flag your project as “updated” on our end and we know to re-grade.
